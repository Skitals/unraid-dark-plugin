# Dark Theme for unRAID webGui

## Install

To install, from the unRAID webGui go to Plugins -> Install Plugin, paste the following url and press Install
  `https://github.com/Skitals/unraid-dark-plugin/raw/master/plugins/dark.theme.plg`
  
## Why a Plugin

Themes are not officially supported in unRAID. Installing as a plugin allows the theme to persist on reboot, as well as override hardcoded CSS. We no longer have to hijack a default theme. With the plugin installed you can switch between this theme and the default themes with no loss of functionality.

## What it Does

On install/boot it copies the custom theme to the appropriate folder, applies a custom Flash.page that supports themeing, and modifies the login page to use the dark theme when the custom theme is in use.
